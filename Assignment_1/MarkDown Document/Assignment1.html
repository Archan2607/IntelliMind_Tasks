<h1>IntelliMind Assignments</h1>
<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
<h3>Part1 : Pre-process text data</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Pre-Processing of text data, Pre-Processing of Data is necessary since it may contain various noises and unwanted data(Ex: Spelling Mistakes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So for removing such noises I used some basic python libraries and performed following processing:-</p>
<pre><code>  Split into Sentences
  Split into Words
  Remove all the words that are not alphabetic
  Remove all the Stop Words
  Stemming of words
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The above mentioned processing techniques were possible by using the nltk python library</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After executing the documents in this code all the documents will become noise free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code for this assignment is attached in the repository named assign_1_1.py</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part2 : Generate sentiment score for each document [ +ve, -ve, neutral ]</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For generating the sentiment of the data, I used Navie Bayes Classifier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Identifying the positive and negative sentiments of the documents, I trained the Bayes Classifier by creating classes :-</p>
<pre><code>  positive vocabulary 
  negative vocabulary
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>After training the classes of Bayes Classifier I took input of documents one after another and calculated the sentiment score of each document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result might not be very much accurate since very less dataset was used for training the classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code for this assignment is attached in the repository named assign_1_2.py</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part3 : Perform Named Entity Recognition within text data</h3>
<ul>
<li>To Perform Named Entity Extraction from the given text document, I used Spacy Library</li>
<li>Details about this Library can be obtained from the below link</li>
</ul>
<p><code>&lt;link&gt;</code> : <a href="https://spacy.io/">https://spacy.io/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Using this Named Extraction of all the text data can be obtained by the program</li>
<li>The code for this assignment is attached in the repository named assign_1_3.py</li>
</ul>
