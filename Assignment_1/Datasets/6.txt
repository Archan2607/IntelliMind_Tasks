Gold futures on Tuesday gave back all of the previous day’s gains and then some, marking their lowest finish in nearly three weeks, as the dollar strengthened ahead of a widely expected interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve.

The Fed will wrap up a two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, with a decision on interest rates and a press conference to follow.

“We can assume that [on Wednesday,] the FOMC will raise the fed-funds rate target by 0.25%,” said Alasdair Macleod, head of research at Goldmoney.

But “the market will be watching for indications of further rate hikes,” he said. “While it is now generally accepted that global growth is synchronised, raising the possibility of four further rate increases rather than just three, it is worth noting that the dollar has stabilised, and commodity prices have tended to drift a little lower recently.”

“On that basis, the FOMC’s minutes might indicate that .25% is enough for now,” said Macleod. “Gold has been consolidating in a band between $1,310 and $1,360 since late-January, and I expect a quarter point rate rise is fully discounted.”

April gold GCJ8, -0.02% fell $5.90, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,311.90 per ounce. Prices ended at the lowest finish since March 1, when prices settled at $1,305.20—their lowest settlement year to date, according to FactSet data. May silver SIK8, +0.09%  also fell 0.9% to $16.185 an ounce.

Higher interest rates usually drive the dollar north and can reduce the appeal of nonyielding precious metals, but gold holders are also watching to make sure a rate-hiking Fed stays ahead of the curve in staving off inflation, against which gold typically acts as a hedge.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.54%  was up 0.6% at 90.32 Tuesday. Gold and the dollar typically move inversely, as moves in the U.S. unit can influence the attractiveness of commodities to holders of other currencies.

Gold’s downside was limited in part by the extension of a tech-driven stock selloff, a reflection of a shift toward risk-off sentiment hobbling the equity market in the wake of an election-related Facebook FB, -2.56% data revelation. 

Meanwhile, May copper HGK8, +0.21%  fell 1.4% to $3.038 a pound. April platinum PLJ8, +0.04% fell 1% to $945 an ounce, while June palladium PAM8, +0.14%  shed 1.2% to $975.90 an ounce.

Among exchange-traded funds, the silver-focused exchange-traded iShares Silver Trust SLV, -0.71%  fell 0.8%, while the SPDR Gold Shares GLD, -0.45% eased by 0.3% and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -1.12% retreated 1.2%.
